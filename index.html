            I'm a Front-End Development student, currently heading into my
            second year of studies at Noroff. I'm eager to expand my skills and
            dive deeper into the world of web development, building
            user-friendly and accessible web experiences. Originally from
            Norway, I hold a bachelor's degree in Occupational Therapy and have
            a solid foundation in working with people. Currently, I work as a
            supervisor at a company here in Norway, bringing strong leadership
            and problem-solving skills to the table.
          </p>
          <p class="about-paragraph">
            At 28, I'm excited to combine my background and my growing knowledge
            in tech to make a meaningful impact. Looking forward to what's ahead
            in my coding journey!
          </p>

            Currently this portfolio is a work in progress, only using simple
            HTML and CSS. See Bidly and Loopcart projects for a more advanced
            project with React and Tailwind.
